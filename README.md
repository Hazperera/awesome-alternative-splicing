## What is this?
This is a list of software packages (and the people developing these methods) for alternative splicing. [Contributions welcome](https://github.com/hussainather/awesome-alternative-splicing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)...

## Types of alternative splicing
 - Skipped exon or cassette exon (SE): An exon can be retained or spliced out of
 the primary transcript.
 - Mutually exclusion exons (MXE): One of two exons is retained in mRNA splicing
, but not both.
 - Alternative 5' splice site (A5SS): An alternative 5' splice junction (donor s
ite) is used that changes the 3' boundary of the upstream exon.
 - Alternative 3' splice site (A3SS): An alternative 3' splice junction (accepto
r site) is used that changes the 5' boundary of the downstream exon.
 - Retained intron (RI): A sequenced may be spliced out as an intron or retained
, and there are no flanking introns.
